        Computer Programming, I am eager to begin my career in the field.<br>
        During my time in college, I have acquired a strong foundation in<br>
        programming languages such as c, Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
        I have also developed software development, web application development,<br>
        full-stack development, object-oriented programming, database management,<br>
        and system analysis skills through various projects and coursework. <br>

            and testing software, building websites, analyzing data, and<br>
            developing solutions to complex problems. One of my most <br>
            significant accomplishments was developing a program that<br>
            automated generating reports for a local non-profit organization,<br>
            saving them significant time and resources.</p><br>
